2015-12-19 Username (email address) for Google API authentication can now be set using via a system environment variable with a key named as [APPNAME]_USER, where [APPNAME] is 'GOOGLE_APIS' default, e.g. GOOGLE_APIS_USER = me@example-domain.com
Updates to support recent API additions, including Management API view bot filtering flag.

2015-12-12 Ability to query past 10 metrics by automatically joining API results by there dimensions. Added methods for NOTing one-of-in-list '[]' dimension and within-range '<>' metric expressions. Default date ragne has been pushed back 1 day to ensure complete data is returned by MCF queries.

2015-11-27 Support multiple segments being applied to a query.

2015-11-25 profileId argument for Query generators is deprecated.

2015-09-25 gaGoal objects now include goal configuration details.

2015-09-20 Comparators are now generic functions with methods for supplying a .var (LHS) and .operand (RHS)

2015-09-18 PerUser and PerSession can now be used instead of SegmentFilters to create a scoped segment filter list. Also, Include and Exclude have been added to add include and exclude (i.e negate) filters to a segment definition, rather than needing to use the negate argument of the Sequence and SegmentConditionFilter functions.
Added function for generating a segment definition from a list where ... can be used to mean 'followed-by / Later' prior to the next step in the sequence. Note this function uses non-standard evaluation.
PerHit can be used to transform a condition filter into a sequence of length one, which offers a powerful form of segmentation where all conditions must be met for a single hit rather than scoped across sessions or users.
Expr can now be used with a formula denoted by the prefix `~`. This uses non-standard evaluation so that variable names and condition operators do not need to be surrounded by quotation marks.
Added IsNegated generic function and method for testing whether a segment filter's negated slot is set to TRUE.

2015-09-16 Renamed segmentation functions: GaSequenceCondition -> Sequence; GaNonSequenceCondition -> SegmentConditionFilter; GaSegmentCondition -> SegmentFilters

2015-09-15 Renamed GaSequence to Sequence. Added PerUser, PerSession and PerHit generic functions for setting the scope of segment filters, and metrics conditions used within segments. Also, renamed GaScopeLevel and GaScopeLevel<- functions to ScopeLevel and ScopeLevel<- respectively. Sampling warnings are now more informative by notifying you of the total sample size and space with a sampling rate percentage too. Authentication credentials are remembered between commands without the need for the user to store them in a local variable.

2015-09-01 Added Domain Specific Language (DSL) functions utilising Non-standard Evaluation (NSE) for defining conditions and sequences.
2015-08-20 Renamed segmentation functions: GaStartsWith -> First, GaPreceeds -> Later, GaImmediatelyPreceeds -> Then . Renamed operator to comparator. Added functions to set scope of segment filters and segment metric expressions.

2015-04-06 Added function for setting or getting the scope level of segments and expressions.
2015-04-05 Added support for dateOfSession dimension when used for segmention. Suggest valid dimension and metric names to the user if a partial match is found. Automatic handling of date formatting for API requests and responses.
2015-04-04 Added support for list and range comparator operators when used for segment expressions.

2015-03-22 Ability to update and delete existing resource entities such as user links.
2015-03-21 Query view filter definitions. Ability to insert new resource entities where supported by the Management API, e.g. adding new user links. Also, ability to query defintions of custom dimensions and metrics via the management API
2015-02-12 Ability to query user permissions for accounts, properties and views via the Management Api.
2015-02-09 Added Google Tag Manager classes and methods.

2015-01-29 Extend GaSegment methods to accept a gaUserSegment class object in addition to already accepted expressions and segment IDs.

2015-01-26 Automatically select view from a given gaProperty or gaAccount class object. Extend GaQuery methods to accept a gaView class object in addition to already accepted view IDs. Ability to request user defined segments via the Management API. If no OAuth app creds provided, then use JSON file in current directory called ".app_oauth_creds.json" if exists.

2015-01-25 Query the Google Tag Manager API
2015-01-12 Values for various class properties defined as factors with appropriate levels.
