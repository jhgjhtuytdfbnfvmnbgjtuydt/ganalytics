ganalytics
==========
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdeboer/ganalytics.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdeboer/ganalytics)

Interact with **Google Analytics** using **R**

Classes and methods for interactive use of the Google Analytics core reporting, real-time, multi-channel funnel reporting, metadata, configuration management, and Google Tag Manager APIs using R.

This package provides functions for querying the Google Analytics core reporting, real-time, multi-channel funnel and management APIs, as well as the Google Tag Manager API. Write methods are also provided for the management and Google Tag Manager APIs so that you can change tag, property or view settings, for example. Define reporting queries using natural R expressions instead of being concerned as much about API technical intricacies like query syntax, character code escaping, and API limitations.

Updates
-------
Many new functions have been provided for writing segmentation expressions:

* `Segment(...)` - define a segment based one or more expressions or select a built-in segment by its ID number.
* `Include(...)` - expressions (conditions or sequences) defining users or sessions to include in the segment
* `Exclude(...)` - expressions (conditions or sequences) defining users or sessions to exclude from the segment
* `PerUser(...)` - set the scope of one or more segment conditions or sequences to user-level, or set the scope of a metric condition to user-level.
* `PerSession(...)` - set the scope of one or more segment conditions or sequences to user-level, or set the scope of a metric condition to session-level.
* `PerHit(...)` - specify that a set of logically combined conditions must all be met for a single hit, or set the scope of a metric condition to hit-level.
* `Sequence(...)` - define a sequence of one or more conditions to use in a segment definition.
* `Then(condition)` - used within a `Sequence()` to specify that this condition must immediately follow the preceding condition, rather than just any time after.
* `Later(condition)` - similar to `Then()` but means that a condition can happen any time after the preceding condition.
* `First(condition)` - similar to `Then()` but means that a condition must be the first ever interaction (hit) by the user within the specified date-range. Using `First()` is optional. Without using `First()` at the start of a sequence, then the first condition does not need to match the first interaction by the user. It does not make sense to use `First()` anywhere else in the sequence other than at the start.

Function names have changed, however the old function names are still supported for backwards compatibility. This has been done to generalise the functions for use across a wider range of Google Analytics related APIs.

Multi-channel funnel (MCF) and real-time (RT) queries can now be constructed, but work is still needed to be done to process the response from these queries - stay tuned for updates on this.

Instead of using `GaOr`, `GaAnd`, and `GaNot` (now called `Or`, `And`, and `Not`, respectively), it is now possible to use familiar R language Boolean operators, `|` (`Or`), `&` (`And`), and `!` (`Not`) instead (thanks to @hadley for suggestion [#2](https://github.com/jdeboer/ganalytics/issues/2)). It is important to keep in mind however that Google Analytics requires `Or` to have precedence over `And`, which is the opposite to the natural precedence given by R when using the `|` and `&` operators. Therefore, remember to use parentheses `()` to force the order of operation applied to your Boolean expressions.

There is now support for user and session level condition based segments as well as sequential segmentation.

Also recently added is Google Management API support (still a work in progress) - so now you can get details in R about what goals you have defined, accounts, properties, views, etc. There are *write* methods in there too, but these have not been fully tested so perhaps try them under a test login if you want, otherwise just avoid using the "INSERT", "UPDATE" and "DELETE" methods.

There is also some basic support for the Google Tag Manager API, but again, still work in progress.

Installation
------------
### 1. Install the necessary packages into R

#### Warning
* The ganalytics package is currently under development.
* The installation procedure below installs directly from the GitHub repository.

#### Prerequisites
* Ensure you have installed the latest version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/)
* If using Windows, you will also need the latest version of [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
* For other operating systems, please refer to [installation instructions for devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/blob/master/README.md)

#### Execute the following statements in R to install ganalytics:

```r
# Install the latest version of devtools via CRAN
install.packages("devtools")
# Install ganalytics via the GitHub repository.
devtools::install_github("jdeboer/ganalytics")
# End
```

#### Now, restart R.
* This is important to ensure you have a clean workspace to avoid possible errors.

### 2. Prepare your Google API application _(you only need to do this once)_
* Browse to [**Google API Console**] (https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
* Check you are **signed into Google** with the account you wish to use.
* Choose **Create Project** from the Google API Console and give your project a name (or choose an existing project if you have one already).
* From the **APIs** page, enable the **Analytics API**. You may also want to enable the **Tag Manager API** if you wish to try that.
* You will need to **agree** and **accept** the Google APIs and Analytics API Terms of Service to proceed.
* Go to the **Credentials** page, click **Add credentials**, choose **OAuth 2.0 client ID**, then select "Other".
* Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and download the JSON file to your R working directory.

_Note: For further information about Google APIs, please refer to the [References section](https://github.com/jdeboer/ganalytics/blob/master/README.md#useful-references) at the end of this document._

### 3. Set your system environment variables _(this is optional but recommended)_
* Add the following two user variables:

  |     | Variable name                 | Variable value         |
  | --- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  |   1 | `GOOGLE_APIS_CONSUMER_ID`     | `<Your client ID>`     |
  |   2 | `GOOGLE_APIS_CONSUMER_SECRET` | `<Your client secret>` |

  * To do this in Windows:
    * Search for and select **"Edit Environment Variables For Your Account"** from the Start menu.
    * Within the **Environment Variables** window, add the above **User Variables** by selecting **New** and entering the **Variable Name** and **Variable Value**, then click **OK**. Do this for both variables listed in the above table.
    * Click **OK**.
    * **Restart** your computer for the new environment variables to take effect.
  * There is also free open source utility to set environment variables on Mac OS called [EnvPane](https://github.com/hschmidt/EnvPane)
  * Another method that works across platforms is to create an `.Renviron` file that is structured like this:
  
```
GOOGLE_APIS_CONSUMER_ID = <Your client ID>
GOOGLE_APIS_CONSUMER_SECRET = <Your client secret>
```

**Alternatively** you can temporarily set your environment variables straight from R using this command:

```r
Sys.setenv(
  GOOGLE_APIS_CONSUMER_ID = "<Your client ID>",
  GOOGLE_APIS_CONSUMER_SECRET = "<Your client secret>"
)
```

  _Note: For other operating systems please refer to the Reference section at the end of this document._

### 4. Authenticate and attempt your first query with ganalytics
* ganalytics needs to know the ID of the Google Analytics **view** that you wish to query. You can obtain this in a number of ways:
  * Using the [Google Analytics Query Explorer tool](http://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/explorer/)
  * From the **Admin page** in Google Analytics under **View Settings**, or
  * The browser's address bar when viewing a report in Google Analytics - look for the digits between the letter **'p'** and trailing **'/'**, e.g. `.../a11111111w22222222p33333333/` shows a view ID of `33333333`.

* **Alternatively, ganalytics can look up the view ID for you:**
  * If you have access to only one Google Analytics account, with one property, then ganalytics will automatically select the default view for you.
  * Otherwise it will select the default view of the first property from the first account it finds in the list of accounts you have access to.

* Return to R and execute the following to load the ganalytics package:

  ```r
  library(ganalytics)
  ```

* If you successfully set your system environment variables in step 3 above, then execute the following, optionally providing the email address you use to sign-in to Google Analytics:

  ```r
  my_creds <- GoogleApiCreds("you@domain.com")
  ```

* Otherwise do one of the following:
  * If you downloaded the JSON file containing your Google API app credentials, then provide the file path:

    ```r
    my_creds <- GoogleApiCreds("you@domain.com", "client_secret.json")
    ```
  * Instead of a file you can supply the `client_id` and `client_secret` directly:

    ```r
    my_creds <- GoogleApiCreds(
      "you@domain.com",
      list(client_id = "<client id>", client_secret = "<client secret>")
    )
    ```

* Now formulate and run your Google Analytics query, remembering to substitute `view_id` with the view ID you wish to use:

  ```r
  myQuery <- GaQuery( view_id, my_creds )
  GetGaData(myQuery)
  ```

* You should then be directed to *accounts.google.com* within your default web browser asking you to sign-in to your Google account if you are not already. Once signed-in you will be asked to grant read-only access to your Google Analytics account for the Google API project you created in step 1.
* Make sure you are signed into the Google account you wish to use, then grant access by selecting **"Allow access"**. You can then close the page and return back to R.

If you have successfully executed all of the above R commands you should see the output of the default ganalytics query; sessions by day for the past 7 days, for example:

```
        date sessions
1 2015-03-27     2988
2 2015-03-28     1594
3 2015-03-29     1912
4 2015-03-30     3061
5 2015-03-31     2609
6 2015-04-01     2762
7 2015-04-02     2179
8 2015-04-03     1552
```

_Note: A small file will be saved to your home directory ('My Documents' in Windows) containing your new reusable authentication token._

Examples
--------

As demonstrated in the installation steps above, before executing any of the following examples:

1. load the ganalytics package
2. generate a `gaQuery` object with a Google Analytics view ID and API app credentials assigned to it.

### Asumptions

**The following examples assume you have successfully completed the above steps and have named your Google Analytics query object: `myQuery`.**

### Example 1 - Setting the date range

```r
# Set the date range from 1 January 2013 to 31 May 2013: (Dates are specified in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".)
DateRange(myQuery) <- c("2013-01-01", "2013-05-31")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)

# Adjust the start date to 1 March 2013:
StartDate(myQuery) <- "2013-03-01"
# Adjust the end date to 31 March 2013:
EndDate(myQuery) <- "2013-03-31"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 2 - Choosing what metrics to report

```r
# Report number of page views instead
Metrics(myQuery) <- "pageviews"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)

# Report both pageviews and sessions
Metrics(myQuery) <- c("pageviews", "sessions")
# These variations are also acceptable
Metrics(myQuery) <- c("ga:pageviews", "ga.sessions")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 3 - Selecting what dimensions to split your metrics by

```r
# Similar to metrics, but for dimensions
Dimensions(myQuery) <- c("year", "week", "dayOfWeek", "hour")

# Lets set a wider date range
DateRange(myQuery) <- c("2012-10-01", "2013-03-31")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
tail(myData)
# End
```

### Example 4 - Sort by

```r
# Sort by descending number of pageviews
SortBy(myQuery) <- "-pageviews"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
tail(myData)
# End
```

### Example 5 - Row filters

```r
# Filter for Sunday sessions only
sundayExpr <- Expr("dayofweek", "=", "0")
TableFilter(myQuery) <- sundayExpr

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)

# Remove the filter
TableFilter(myQuery) <- NULL

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
# End
```

### Example 6 - Combining filters with AND

```r
# Expression to define Sunday sessions
sundayExpr <- Expr("dayofweek", "=", "0")
# Expression to define organic search sessions
organicExpr <- Expr("medium", "=", "organic")
# Expression to define organic search sessions made on a Sunday
sundayOrganic <- sundayExpr & organicExpr
TableFilter(myQuery) <- sundayOrganic

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)

# Let's concatenate medium to the dimensions for our query
Dimensions(myQuery) <- c(Dimensions(myQuery), "medium")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
# End
```

### Example 7 - Combining filters with OR

```r
# In a similar way to AND
loyalExpr <- Expr("sessionCount", "!~", "^[0-3]$") # Made more than 3 sessions
recentExpr <- Expr("daysSinceLastSession", "~", "^[0-6]$") # Visited sometime within the past 7 days.
loyalOrRecent <- loyalExpr | recentExpr
TableFilter(myQuery) <- loyalOrRecent

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 8 - Filters that combine ORs with ANDs

```r
loyalExpr <- Expr("sessionCount", "!~", "^[0-3]$") # Made more than 3 sessions
recentExpr <- Expr("daysSinceLastSession", "~", "^[0-6]$") # Visited sometime within the past 7 days.
loyalOrRecent <- loyalExpr | recentExpr
sundayExpr <- Expr("dayOfWeek", "=", "0")
loyalOrRecent_Sunday <- loyalOrRecent & sundayExpr
TableFilter(myQuery) <- loyalOrRecent_Sunday

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)

# Perform the same query but change which dimensions to view
Dimensions(myQuery) <- c("sessionCount", "daysSinceLastSession", "dayOfWeek")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 9 - Sorting 'numeric' dimensions (continuing from example 8)

```r
# Continuing from example 8...

# Change filter to loyal session AND recent sessions AND visited on Sunday
loyalAndRecent_Sunday <- loyalExpr & recentExpr & sundayExpr
TableFilter(myQuery) <- loyalAndRecent_Sunday

# Sort by decending visit count and ascending days since last visit.
SortBy(myQuery) <- c("-sessionCount", "+daysSinceLastSession")
myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)

# Notice that Google Analytics' Core Reporting API doesn't recognise 'numerical' dimensions as
# ordered factors when sorting. We can use R to sort instead, using a plyr::arrange function.
library(plyr)
myData <- arrange(myData, desc(sessionCount), daysSinceLastSession)
head(myData)
tail(myData)
# End
```

### Example 10 - Session segmentation

```r
# Visit segmentation is expressed similarly to row filters and supports AND and OR combinations.
# Define a segment for sessions where a "thank-you", "thankyou" or "success" page was viewed.
thankyouExpr <- Expr("pagePath", "~", "thank\\-?you|success")
Segment(myQuery) <- thankyouExpr

# Reset the filter
TableFilter(myQuery) <- NULL

# Split by traffic source and medium
Dimensions(myQuery) <- c("source", "medium")

# Sort by decending number of sessions
SortBy(myQuery) <- "-sessions"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
# End
```

### Example 11 - Using automatic pagination to get more than 10,000 rows of data per query

```r
# Sessions by date and hour for the years 2011 (leap year) and 2012: 2 * 365.5 * 24 = 17544 rows
# First let's clear any filters or segments defined previously
TableFilter(myQuery) <- NULL
Segment(myQuery) <- NULL
# Define our date range
DateRange(myQuery) <- c("2011-01-01", "2012-12-31")
# Define our metrics and dimensions
Metrics(myQuery) <- "sessions"
Dimensions(myQuery) <- c("date", "dayOfWeek", "hour")
# Let's allow a maximum of 17544 rows (default is 10000)
MaxResults(myQuery) <- 17544

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
nrow(myData)

## Let's use plyr::ddply to analyse the data
library(plyr)

# Sessions by day of week
sessions_by_dayOfWeek <- ddply(myData, ~dayOfWeek, summarise, sessions = sum(sessions))
with(sessions_by_dayOfWeek, barplot(sessions, names.arg=dayOfWeek))

# Sessions by hour of day
sessions_by_hour <- ddply(myData, ~hour, summarise, sessions = sum(sessions))
with(sessions_by_hour, barplot(sessions, names.arg=hour))
# End
```

### Example 12 - Using ggplot2
To run this example first install ggplot2 if you haven't already.

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Once installed, then run the following example.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

# Sessions by date and hour for the years 2011 (leap year) and 2012: 2 * 365.5 * 24 = 17544 rows
# First let's clear any filters or segments defined previously
TableFilter(myQuery) <- NULL
Segment(myQuery) <- NULL
# Define our date range
DateRange(myQuery) <- c("2011-01-01", "2012-12-31")
# Define our metrics and dimensions
Metrics(myQuery) <- "sessions"
Dimensions(myQuery) <- c("date", "dayOfWeek", "hour", "isMobile")
# Let's allow a maximum of 40000 rows (default is 10000)
MaxResults(myQuery) <- 40000

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)

# Sessions by hour of day and day of week
avg_sessions_by_hour_wday_mobile <- ddply(
  myData,
  ~hour + dayOfWeek + isMobile,
  summarise,
  sessions = mean(sessions)
)

# Relabel the days of week
levels(avg_sessions_by_hour_wday_mobile$dayOfWeek) <- c(
  "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"
)

# Plot the summary data
qplot(
  x = hour,
  y = sessions,
  data = avg_sessions_by_hour_wday_mobile,
  facets = ~dayOfWeek,
  fill = isMobile,
  geom = "bar",
  position = "stack",
  stat = "identity"
)

# End
```
