\arguments{
\item{object}{A sequence step or another expression that should be coerced to
a sequence condition.}

\item{...}{Other steps within the sequence condition, in the order in which
they should be applied.}

\item{negation}{Logical TRUE or FALSE to match segments where this sequence
has not occured.}

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{.compoundExpr}: Defines a sequence step using the supplied expression that does
not need to be immediately at the start nor immediately following any
preceeding step.

\item \code{.compoundExpr}: Defines a sequencial step using the supplied expression
that should immediately follow any preceding step or be the very first
required interaction in any sequences being matched to this sequential
segment definition.

\item \code{.compoundExpr}: Alias to Then.

\item \code{.compoundExpr}: Return a seuqnece of length of one step using the
supplied expression to define that step, where that step can occur anywhere
with the sequences of interactions being matched.
